# OpenCrypt

(the game)

A LÖVE2D powered open source game based on Crypt of the NecroDancer

Disclaimer: This project was not made to re-create CotND, but to create a new, highly customizable community-run game. Zakru or any other OpenCrypt repository admin is not responsible for – and we fact discourage – any external mods for the game which may contain copyright infringing content.

A tool may be created in the future which allows for copying the contents of a legitimate copy of CotND into a format compatible with OpenCrypt, but which will not distribute the content.

OpenCrypt and the contents of this repository have absolutely no warranty, express or implied. A better license should probably be used at some point.

## The h*ck is game even

OpenCrypt is based on an awesome game called [Crypt of the NecroDancer](https://braceyourselfgames.com/crypt-of-the-necrodancer/). It is a roguelike rhythm game where the player explores randomly generated dungeons to progress the protagonists' story.

OpenCrypt revolves around a similar mechanic – rhythm-based exploration of areas – but its content will be completely community-created with a base module to get started (The base module is a mod itself, so you can also use it to learn from an example how to make your own mods! It also means that features for the base game should first be implemented in the API for everyone to use!). The game will feature an extensive and easy-to-use (but also advanced if necessary) API that can be used to customize nearly all of the game's aspects. Players can create their own textures, enemies, bosses, level generators and much more, with minimal effort.

## But if it's free, it's bad

If you find a bug, a lack of a feature, or just think an existing feature is bad, you can do something about it! Open an issue, or fix it yourself and open a pull request! OpenCrypt is completely open source and everyone can edit it. This also brings safety to it, as everyone can check the source code to make sure nothing bad is trying to lurk in.
